# sales-predictions

This project analyzed various factors of outlet stores to predict item sales.

Some relevant insights were obtained.  First, we found that medium outlet stores have greater total volume of sales and the large outlet stores.  In addition, we found that sales are most correlated with an item's weight.

The linear regression model proved to be the best, with 0.43 R^2 value on the test data, as well as a 1304 RMSE.  I recommend a linear regression as its metrics were better than the decision tree model.

In summary, I recommend selling more items of greater weight as they generally sell at a higher rate.
